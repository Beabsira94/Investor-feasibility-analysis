# TellCo Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the TellCo Analysis Project! This initiative is aimed at providing a comprehensive evaluation of TellCo, a mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia, to help our investor make an informed decision about purchasing the company. 

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Analyze Opportunities for Growth**: Utilize the telecommunication dataset to uncover potential growth opportunities for TellCo. This will include examining customer behavior, network usage patterns, and identifying areas where profitability can be enhanced.

2. **Provide Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, offer strategic recommendations on whether TellCo is a worthwhile investment or if it would be better to pass on the opportunity.

3. **Deliver Insights**: Present the findings through a user-friendly web-based dashboard and a detailed written report. The dashboard will provide an interactive way to explore the data and insights, while the report will summarize the key findings and recommendations.

## Situational Overview

You are working for a wealthy investor specializing in purchasing undervalued assets. The investor's due diligence process includes thorough data analysis to understand the fundamentals of potential acquisitions and identify opportunities to enhance profitability.

Your task is to analyze the telecommunication dataset provided by TellCo, focusing on customer and network data to identify growth opportunities and assess the investment potential.

## Deliverables
